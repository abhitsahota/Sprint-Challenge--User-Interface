# Sprint Challenge: User Interface and Git - Multi-Page Website

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored User Interface and Git. During this Sprint, you studied Semantic HTML, CSS Fundamentals, CSS Flexbox Module, and Git. 
## Instructions

## Description

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your web page should look like the solution screen shots of the home and about pages:

## Self-Study Questions

1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

	Semantic HTML is markup that is descriptive of the contained content. It can be viewed as meta description of the content type so that bots and accessibility feature user (e.g. screenreader) can parse through content more efficiently. 


2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

	Block will break content into separate lines vs. Inline will remain within the flow of content. Block elements can be manipulated with height and width attributes while inline elements cannot.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

	Content, padding, border, margin. 


4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?

	The cross axis (I.e. the perpendicular axis to the flow of content). The cross axis can change in direction depending on the flex direction.


5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

	Git is valuable for collaborative and traceability purposes. It allows multiple developers to work on a single codebase via branches. It has version control and traceability baked in so that changes can be tracked and managed when tracking any changes in functionality. 


## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

### Home Page

[Review the provided design file for the home page](design-files/home.png).  Notice the navigation and header images are missing.

* [X] Build the HTML and CSS to create the missing navigation and header.
* [X] Link the `About` navigation item to the [about.html](about.html) page

You will also notice there are 10 boxes on the home page that need background colors.  Use this list below to correctly style each box:

* [X] box1: `teal`
* [X] box2: `gold`
* [X] box3: `cadetblue`
* [X] box4: `coral`
* [X] box5: `crimson`
* [X] box6: `forestgreen`
* [X] box7: `darkorchid`
* [X] box8: `hotpink`
* [X] box9: `indigo`
* [X] box10: `dodgerblue`

### About Page

[Review the provided design file for the about page](design-files/about.png). You have been provided the HTML wrapper, footer, and page content for the about page. Create the rest of the missing HTML and CSS to match the design file.

* [X] Copy and paste your home page navigation and header into the about page
* [X] Update the header image with the about page image
* [X] Link the `Home` navigation item back to the `index.html` page.
* [X] Build the rest of the about page layout to match the design

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

## Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

* [X] Build a page of your choosing from the navigation items.  Come up with content and images that fit the theme.  
* [X] Introduce CSS animations to your site. > (Nav bar, buttons)
* [X] Build a contact page and create a form with several inputs of your choosing
* [ ] Add responsive breakpoints to your code by using media queries
